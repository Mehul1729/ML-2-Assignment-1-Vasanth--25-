This is the ML-2 Assingment-1 Submission.
It involves exploring basic ML algorithms to classify time series into Periodic, Chaotic, Hyperchaotic and Noise by extracting Recurrence Features.

This serves as a base for the future study where more advanced models like LSTMs, CNN can be applied on Noisy Real World Datasets from Climate, Space, etc.
